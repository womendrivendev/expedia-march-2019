# BODY AND SOUL

http://www.bodyandsoulcharity.org/

We work with 5,500-plus of the most vulnerable children and families in the UK today. We were established in 1996 to formalise the work of our founder, who had spent several years running groups for women and children, primarily refugees, who had experienced the full panoply of trauma in the past – rape, torture, trafficking etc – and continued to live with grave existential uncertainties in the present – homelessness or unstable housing, destitution and a continuing vulnerability to domestic violence and sexual abuse.


## About

Here are some questions to help you get going...

- This project is for BODY & SOUL caseworkers and organizers

- They are having issues with organizing and accessing their user data

- Their user data is currently stored on an Access DB hosted locally (on-premises, we are not sure of exact hosting setup)

- We have set up a Google account for BODY&SOUL 

- We have set up a Google Cloud hosted MySQL DB (owned by aforementioned Google account)

- We have set up a Google Data Studio view for Caseworkers to view data visualizations
