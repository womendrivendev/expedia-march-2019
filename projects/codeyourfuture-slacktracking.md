# Code Your Future: Student tracking system

## About

Code your future, are a non-profit organisation supporting refugees and underprivileged individuals with the dream of becoming developers.

Students at CYF, just like most modern developers and tech employees, spend most of their time online. They are expected to complete a number of weekly activities working remotely and asking online questions, commenting and participating in weekly calls.

A habit-creation process is required throughout the course until students feel comfortable working in this virtual office environment.

#### The tool:
 We want to create a remote monitoring system that automatically logs some basic activity of students in the public Slack channels so that students can understand what actions and frequency they should be aiming for. This would also help instructors understand which students need most attention.

#### Problems trying to solve:
* How well are the students mixing?
* What groupings are occuring?
* Is anyone isolated?
* What topics are students having difficulty with?
* How well are the students completing the homework?
* Is the homework load too much or too little?
